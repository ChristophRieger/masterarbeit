%1. Prior hat im modell funktioniert wie im biologischen experiment. siehe exp 1 cross validation und exp 2 image 6
% weights could be calculated from conditional probabilities
%4. why were the parameters not transferable to bigger network. Why would they even be in the first place? They were not transferable, as we saw in experiment 2 increasing f_input changes the conditional probabilities.


%2. Future work: 
%a. Normalization of U? mby, but it actually makes more sense how it is right now wegen stochastic samples ziehen
%b. implement a prior that is actually influenced by network activity
%c. separate weight shift parameter for input and prior weights. maybe weight shift parameter depending on number of neurons and firing frequency
